The goal of leaidr is to provide an easy way to map U.S. school districts in R.

## Installation

You can install the development version of this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ivelasq/leaidr")
```

## About

School districts in the U.S. have associated local education agency identification numbers (LEAID) used in the [National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)](https://nces.ed.gov/) Common Core of Data. These are very useful because if you have other datasets with NCES IDâ€™s, then you can (sometimes easily) join them.

The original shapefiles can be found on the [NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/DistrictBoundaries) site. These files are from 2019. All the state-level shapefiles are saved [here](https://github.com/datalorax/us-district-shapefiles/tree/master/individ-districts).

## Get the U.S. Shapefile

Load the shapefile for the entire U.S. using `lea_get()` and the state abbreviation. Loading may take a while. You will have to load the shapefile anytime you're in a new directory/project.

If you use `lea_get()` (i.e., with `state = NULL`), you get all the district shapefiles for the whole U.S. via ROpenSci's {piggyback}.

**You must have a GITHUB_PAT before you can run `lea_get()`.** You can set a token in your [developer settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and save it in your R Environment. More info can be found in [Happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html).

## Use the Data

Once you have the shapefile, you can plot using packages like {leaflet} and {ggplot2}.

### {ggplot2} Example

```{r, message = FALSE, dpi = 300}
library(leaidr)

tn <- lea_get("tn")

tn %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf() %>% 
  ggplot2::ggplot() +
  ggplot2::geom_sf()
```
